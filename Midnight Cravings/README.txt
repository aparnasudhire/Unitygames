Midnight Cravings - The Game

Unity Play: (Yet to be published)

Hi I created this game called Midnight Cravings.

About the game: Who deosn't get hungry at night? 

	This is a tiny 3D Game in which there is limited visibility and the player has to find the food specified in the top corner. The food is hidden somewhere around the house and the player has to find it. The audio is of Pink Panther - The show
