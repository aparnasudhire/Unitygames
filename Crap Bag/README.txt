Crap Bag - The Game

Unity Play: https://play.unity.com/mg/other/webgl-builds-380136

Hi I created this game called Crap Bag.

About the game: This is a tiny 2D Game inspired from Flappy Bird which was super popular a while ago. This is an endless game and you can keep playing it till you lose. Try to beat my personal best - 97?

Story of the game: Instead of the Flappy Bird it is a bag of unrecyclable crap (The sign on the bag is just a distraction it is actually not recycleable). The green pipes are the green dustbins and this bag should not end up on the pipes or the ground or in the air. This would lead to Global Warming!
